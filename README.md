# radarqc_scans
This dataset contains example radar scans from both airborne and ground-based radar sources with automated QC scripts used in the Solo II radar editing software package.

The file 'sed.1160322015744.N43RF-Ta.3531._med_autotdr' is an airborne radar QC script developed for use in Solo II in Bell et al. 2013. It has been slightly modified to enact changes on the 'ZZ' field in these scans rather than the 'DBZ' field as Solo II will not allow 'DBZ' to be re-written so the file must act directly on the original backed up field copied during QC efforts. The scan 'swp.1181010123925.N42RF-TM.137.20.0_AIR_v3532' is from within convection in the inner core of Hurricane Micheal (2018) by the tail Doppler radar aboard the NOAA P-3 aircraft. The before and after with regards to the QC script of the 'ZZ' and 'VG' fields of this scan are given as images with the key 'band' in the file name. The scan 'swp.1181010122951.N42RF-TS.196.-20.0_AIR_v3394' is from within the eye of Michael. The before and after of these are also given as images with the key 'eye' in the file name.
